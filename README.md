# Pong-Game
# Programming Club Project

# Scratch:
Create a Scratch project that implements a simple animation, such as a bouncing ball or a character moving across the screen. Add basic interactivity, like user input to control the animation or sound effects upon interaction. 

# My Game: 
A simple Pong game using Scratch. 

# Game Instruction: 
Move your mouse pointer left and right according to the movement of the ball so that the ball hits the paddle and turns to opposite direction when it comes down. 
Every time your score increases if the ball hits the paddle correctly and the background will change if your score reaches multiples of 5.
Your game will end once the ball touches the red line.
